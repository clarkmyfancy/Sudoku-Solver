# Welcome to the Self-Solving Sudoku Puzzle!

Watching a chaotic envrionment slowly sort itself out is extremely satisfying. For that reason, I created this self-solving sudoku animation! If it's not a bad time, go [check it out](#watch)
### What is this project?
It has been said that any sufficiently complex system (that works), evolved from a simpler (also working) system. That idea always fascinates me. 

I got the idea to animate a backtracking algorithm from Youtube. Sorting algorithms the chaos slowly organize itselfslowly takes shape

order come from do much disorder  I built this animation to satisfy my itch to see a complex system working, while understanding completly the parts that put it together. 

### Why does this exist? 
I built this project to practice a recursive algorithm called backtracking. 

### Why does that matter?

### What will happen when you run this program? 


# Watch a puzzle solve itself:
1) Clone or Fork this repo
2) Navigate to the directory you just cloned/forked (using Z shell, Bash, PowerShell, etc.)
3) Install or upgrade `numpy` and `pygame`
    1) Example using pip:
    ```
    clarkmyfancy@pio ~ % pip install numpy
    clarkmyfancy@pio ~ % pip install pygame
    ```
4) Run `python script.py`
