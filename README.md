# Welcome to the Self-Solving Sudoku Puzzle!

## What is this?
This is a demonstration of animating a recursive algorithm called backtracking. Running the program will open up a window with a blank sudoku puzzle that will go on to solve itself. 

## Why does this exist? 
Me personally, I am a big fan of puzzles, sudoku especially. I built this app because I wanted a way to see how a computer might solve a sudoku puzzle (and also to watch as the chaos slowly sorts itself out). For those reasons, I created the Self-Solving Sudoku animation! 

If it's not a bad time, go [check it out](#watch-a-puzzle-solve-itself)

# Watch a puzzle solve itself:
1) Clone or Fork this repo
2) Navigate to the directory you just cloned/forked (using Z shell, Bash, PowerShell, etc.)
3) Install or upgrade `numpy` and `pygame`
    1) Example using pip:
    ```
    clarkmyfancy@pio ~ % pip install numpy
    clarkmyfancy@pio ~ % pip install pygame
    ```
4) Run `python script.py`
